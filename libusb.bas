' ********************************************* USB Open **************************************************
' Prior to be able to perform operations with a device you need to open it by calling USB_Open
' USB_Open returns a magic number called a 'handle' that will be used for subsequent operations
' You need to store that handle in a variable. the handle is a LONG datatype variable
' There are 2 possible ways of opening a device
'    1) By Index
'       Example :       dim my_handle as long
'                       my_index=3
'                       my_handle = USBOpen(my_index,-1,-1)
'                       if my_handle = 0 then debug.print " No device found "
'       The above code would open the device 'my_index' on the usb bus.
'       You need to specify -1 for both VID and VIP. This forces libusb to open by index number.
'       You need to test the returning handle to contain a magic number.
'       If the handle is 0 there was no device at the specified index.
'
'       You can use this method to 'walk' the entire USB bus
'
'       Example :      dim my_handle as long
'                      dim my_index as long
'                      my_index=0
'                      do
'                        my_handle = USBOpen(my_index,-1,-1)
'                        usbclose my_handle
'                        my_index = my_index + 1
'                      loop until my_handle=0
'                      debug.print " There are " & index & " Devices on the USB bus"
'
'    2) Opening by VID / VIP
'       The second mechanism is to open a device directly by VID and VIP
'       Lets assume we have a device where the VID is &hDD8 and hte PID is &hC100 ( this is an example )
'       The following code would open this device ;
'       Example:       Dim my_handle
'                      my_handle= USBopen (0,&hDD8,&hC100)
'                      if my_handle=0 then debug.print " No such device "
'
'       Again , the handle returned needs to be checked. if the handle is 0 this means there is no such device attached.
'       Let's assume we actually have multiple devices with the same VID and PID.
'       It is possible to actually check how many devices there are with this specific VID and PId combination
'
'       Example:       Dim my_handle , my_index as long
'                      Const my_vid = &hdd8
'                      const my_pid = &hc100
'                      my_index=0
'                      do
'                         my_handle= USBopen (my_index,my_vid,my_pid)
'                         usbclose my_handle
'                         my_index=my_index+1
'                      loop until my_handle=0
'                      Debug.Print " There are " & my_index & " devices with VID " & hex$(my_vid) & " PID " & hex$(my_pid)

' ********************************************* USB Close **************************************************

' ********************************************* USB GetDescriptor*******************************************
' Any USB devices contains a set of data called 'descriptors' that provide information about the device
' usbgetdescriptors allows you to retrieve this dataset.
' The returning dataset is a complex structure. In order to make delaing with this data easier a number of predefined
' types have been defined that will directly format the returning data.
'
' Example:  dim my_handle as long
'           dim my_descriptor as USBdeviceDescriptor
'           my_handle=usbopen(0,-1,-1)     ' we open the first device attached
'           if (usbgetdescriptor(my_handle, USB_DT_DEVICE,0,my_descriptor,USB_DT_DEVICE_SIZE) <> USB_DT_DEVICE_SIZE) then
'              debug.print " no descriptor found "
'           end if
'
' USBgetDescriptor returns 0 if the call failed, so you need to check this.
' The retrieved data is loaded into the provided variable ( in this case my_descriptor)
' USBgetdescriptors can get a number of different descriptors. USB provides a Device , Config and interface descriptor.
' The important thing is to call usbgetdescriptors with the correct information :
' Example : dim my_handle as long
'           dim my_descriptor as USBDeviceDescriptor
'           dim my_config     as USBconfigdescriptor

'           usbgetdescriptor (my_handle, USB_DT_DEVICE   ,0,my_descriptor,USB_DT_DEVICE_SIZE)
